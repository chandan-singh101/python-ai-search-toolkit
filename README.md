## 📖 Description
The **python-ai-search-toolkit** is a user-friendly toolkit designed to help you understand AI search algorithms. This toolkit implements various foundational algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* for solving grid-based maze problems. Whether you are a student or just curious about artificial intelligence, this toolkit provides a straightforward way to explore these concepts.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Modular Design:** Each algorithm is modular, making it easy to switch between them.
- **Visual Demonstration:** View the search process through interactive visualization.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear guides for using the toolkit effectively.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🎓 Understanding the Algorithms
The toolkit focuses on the following algorithms:

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS explores nodes and their children before moving to the next sibling. It uses a stack data structure.

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue.

### 3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
UCS finds the least expensive path to the goal by exploring all the nodes with the lowest path cost first.

### 4. A* Search
A* combines the strengths of UCS and greedy search. It evaluates nodes using a heuristic to guide the search.
